# Advent of Code
My solutions to Advent of Code in languages I want to practice

## 2024
Solved problems using Python

### Day 1
Pretty simple day, I used a merge sort found online because I forgot the sort method existed.

### Day 2
Part one took an embarrassingly long time, the solution in my head was correct, but implemented incorrectly and I couldn't figure out what was wrong. Part two got me to use the debugger for the first time and showed off my lack of reading comprehension. Got it once I read the question right.

### Day 3
Forced to learn regex, thank you regex101 for the visual guide.
